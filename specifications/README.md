| `atproto_governance_transfer_proof.md` | Ontology transfer proof: maps the governor's 5-artifact ontology (MeasurementSnapshot, TransitionProposal, AuthorityReceipt, RecoveryPlanReceipt, ResetReceipt) onto ATProto's PDS and relay layers. Demonstrates domain-independence of the governance primitives and identifies "containment without erasure" as a general capability gap. |
