## Abstract

This work describes a governed reasoning substrate that introduces persistent 
state to language-model systems without granting agency, goals, or 
self-modification. The contribution is architectural: separating linguistic 
proposal from non-linguistic authority, and measuring the resulting system 
using standard tools from queueing theory and supervisory control.

Key results:
- Interiority confirmed via hysteresis testing (16.7% divergence rate)
- Two distinct phase boundaries identified (budget starvation, glass ossification)
- Safety invariants maintained across all experimental conditions
- No agency, consciousness, or alignment claims

The system enforces epistemic constraints by construction and is evaluated 
via falsifiable experiments. 76 test suites confirm architectural properties.


## Key Contributions

- Existing approaches either: • Accept incoherence as a feature (stateless sampling) • Attempt to inject coherence via prompting (unreliable) • Build agent scaffolding with goals and planning (introduces new risks) We propose a fourth path: governed persistence without agency.
