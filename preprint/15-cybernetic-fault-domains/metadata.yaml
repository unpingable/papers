  Many failures in cybernetic systems share a common ordering defect: irreversible commitments can occur before verification-and-response could complete. This paper formalizes cybernetic fault domains as boundary-relative temporal regimes defined by a chosen commitment boundary (C_k), correction horizon (H), commitment lead (Δt), and boundary load (σ). A system admits the mechanism when a race window exists (Δt > 0) and becomes loaded when unverified crossings of C_k accumulate beyond a calibrated threshold (σ > σ_threshold). We provide an operational measurement protocol and ten parameter instantiations mapping the same quantities onto prior domain studies (organizations, language models, security, platforms, representational transforms, optimization pathologies, and synthetic coherence). Finally, we describe an architectural containment pattern—governors that separate proposal from commitment and enforce temporal ordering at C_k—and illustrate it with an evidence-gated reasoning substrate (BLI). The contribution is a minimal, falsifiable failure condition plus a measurement-and-containment pattern that generalizes across heterogeneous cybernetic systems.
