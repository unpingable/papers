## Abstract

We show that temporal lag between control layers acts as effective noise, driving hierarchical systems from narrow high-fidelity basins toward broad degraded attractors via an entropic ratchet. When fast operational layers outpace slow strategic layers (large Δt), control errors accumulate as stochastic forcing with D_eff ∝ Δt². Because high-quality states occupy small phase-space volumes while degraded states occupy large volumes, random exploration preferentially transitions systems downward—not through moral failure, but through statistical mechanics.

- We propose a different answer: Institutional decay is a thermodynamic- style consequence of operating hierarchical systems with insuﬀicient coupling bandwidth under stochastic perturbations.
- Noise-Lag Equivalence Theorem: We derive the relationship D_eff = D_intrinsic + �²Δt², showing that temporal divergence contributes to effective diffusion quadratically.
- Cross-Domain Application: We show the framework applies to both digital platforms and educational institutions, suggesting broader applica- bility to hierarchical systems generally.
