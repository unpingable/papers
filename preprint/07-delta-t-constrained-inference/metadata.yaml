  We present a general framework for temporal coherence in hierarchical inference systems. When upper layers generate outputs at rates exceeding what lower layers can support, systems exhibit characteristic pathologies: confidence inflation, metastable states that appear functional but are structurally fragile, and eventual collapse under perturbation. The core constraint—that confidence growth rate must not exceed evidence accumulation rate—yields a differential inequality dC/dt ≤ k·dE/dt governing system behavior. Violations accumulate as temporal debt D(t), a measure of structural fragility invisible in local observations. The framework reveals three distinct regimes: coherent inference, metastable inference, and collapse. We demonstrate that meta-plausibility constitutes one instantiation of this general principle and establish connections to existing theories of metastability in stochastic systems and multiscale dynamics. Domain-specific applications are developed in companion publications.
