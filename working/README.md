# Working Papers

Exploratory and in-progress writing that has not been published as a preprint. These documents serve as upstream framing, personal reference, or theoretical substrate for the Δt framework series.

## Contents

- **polish_room.md** — *The Polish Room*: A thermodynamic reframing of Searle's Chinese Room argument, analyzing understanding through temporal closure and energy constraints rather than symbolic manipulation.

- **agi-requirements-framework.md** — *AGI Requirements Framework*: A three-tier diagnostic framework (Tier 1: temporal coherence, Tier 2: representational invariance, Tier 3: recursive self-modeling) for evaluating AGI capability claims.

- **tier0.md** — *Tier 0: Formation Requirements*: An extension to the AGI Requirements Framework covering pre-architectural conditions (substrate requirements, boundary formation, coherence nucleation).

- **governor-not-mind.md** — *Why a Governor is Not a Mind*: Governors as stability controllers: preventing false state injection through admissibility gates and coherence budgets. The pragmatic AI safety intervention that doesn't require solving consciousness.

- **jarbrain.md** — *The Jar Brain, or: Wernicke's Aphasia at Scale*: LLMs as high-bandwidth language production systems unbundled from the stabilizers that normally accompany fluent speech — episodic memory with provenance, error interrupts outside the generation channel, costed action selection, and developmental convergence. Argues hallucination is the default behavior of a production system with no interrupt line and no cost function, not a reasoning failure. Inventories the missing subsystems, distinguishes installable prosthetics (governor, episodic store, action policy) from non-installable formation (developmental annealing), and draws the line between governed instruments and constitutive agents.

- **gim.md** — *Governor Insertion Method (GIM)*: A seven-step design methodology for placing temporal governors in layered systems — "control theory meets SRE threat modeling." Operationalizes Δt measurement, σ boundary-load estimation, and a G0–G4 enforcement taxonomy (observability → soft gate → hard gate → capability proxy → closed-loop controller) into a placement algorithm with computable inputs (risk, control gap, boundary stress). Includes bypass test suite as falsifier. The operational bridge between paper [15] (theory) and *The Jar Brain* (motivation). Provenance: DeepSeek → ChatGPT → Claude cross-model session.

- **ground_stops_moving.md** — *The Ground Stops Moving: Labels, Receipts, and the Phenomenology of Public Memory*: Companion to Paper 17 (Receipt the Compiler). Asks what it *feels like* to live under opaque narrative manipulation, and what "interruptibility" — not truth, not consensus — actually provides. Paper 18 candidate.

- **who_governs_the_compiler.md** — *Who Governs the Compiler? Receipts, Authority, and the Agentic Software Supply Chain*: The build pipeline as a policy-bearing system. When agents write software, informal trust collapses and the governance layer becomes the contested territory. Argues for receipted governance vs extractive governance-as-a-service.
