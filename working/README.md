# Working Papers

Exploratory and in-progress writing that has not been published as a preprint. These documents serve as upstream framing, personal reference, or theoretical substrate for the Δt framework series.

## Contents

- **polish_room.md** — *The Polish Room*: A thermodynamic reframing of Searle's Chinese Room argument, analyzing understanding through temporal closure and energy constraints rather than symbolic manipulation.

- **agi-requirements-framework.md** — *AGI Requirements Framework*: A three-tier diagnostic framework (Tier 1: temporal coherence, Tier 2: representational invariance, Tier 3: recursive self-modeling) for evaluating AGI capability claims.

- **tier0.md** — *Tier 0: Formation Requirements*: An extension to the AGI Requirements Framework covering pre-architectural conditions (substrate requirements, boundary formation, coherence nucleation).
