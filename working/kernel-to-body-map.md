# From kernel to body: a map for Admissibility Calculus

> **Status:** internal roadmap / body map.
> Not a 2.0 commitment. Not an implementation queue. Not a public-surface promise.
> Each slice requires a coherent, non-vacuous formal question and its own intrinsic review.
> A runtime consumer is not a prerequisite for formal work; formalization may establish the

> The 2.0 body is allowed to remain partially unbuilt. This map names dependency order, not destiny.

Companion documents:

- [[calculus-2-exit-criteria]] — the six conditions under which "Calculus 2.0" is a thing that exists.
- [[frontier-proof-obligations]] — the per-slice five-step proof pattern + the ledger table.

## Context

The Lean repo (~/git/lean) already carries most of the diagnosis: `FRONTIERS.md` names four load-bearing gaps (+ a reserved fifth), `LocalBoundary.lean` is an aperture toward the process-composition track, and `LeanProofs/Admissibility/README.md` distinguishes the 1.0 public surface (8 modules) from a green-but-unpromised annex (13 modules) plus paper-anchored specimens.

This map does not invent a new agenda. It synthesizes what's already in the register, orders it by load-bearing dependency (per `FRONTIERS.md`: load-bearing first, not tractable first), and turns each frontier into a proof obligation with a counterexample-first cadence.

Exit criteria live in [[calculus-2-exit-criteria]]. The proof pattern + ledger live in [[frontier-proof-obligations]].

Green = shipped. Red = counterexample specimens (the negative testimony each slice must land *before* any bridge theorem). Blue = the destination, allowed to remain unbuilt. Edges are *requires*, not *suggests*.

## Slice-by-slice — what each piece actually adds

### Slice A — Safety bridge (Frontier 1, load-bearing)

Without a safety bridge, the kernel may claim authorization discipline, but not value preservation or safety. That is the whole of the public framing the bridge buys; nothing larger.

**First executable step — and the only file this plan asks for as Phase 1:**

- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/AuthorizedNotSafe.lean` — two states, one authorized step, one defended value, value decreases. Therefore `AuthorizedStep` does not imply `SafetyPreserving`. Small enough that it cannot become a framework.

> This proves `AuthorizedStep` does not imply preservation of *arbitrary* defended value. It does not prove that no safety bridge exists.

That single file does real work. It mechanically exhibits the wound the rest of Slice A is allowed to address. Stop after it lands. Inspect the shape. Then the next plan-side sentence becomes earned:

> Since authorization alone does not imply preservation of defended value, any safety claim requires additional bridge structure.

Only then, and only if the shape forces it, the rest of Slice A:

- `DefendedValue.lean` — abstract opaque type, same discipline as `Freshness.Time`.
- `SafetyPreserving.lean` — predicate over `Step` parameterized by `DefendedValue`. Three candidate bridge predicates as separate definitions so future work can compare: `WitnessSafetyPreserving` (lift `EncapsulatedWrt`), `AggregatorSafetyPreserving` (lift papers-side $D_A$), `ReceiptSafetyPreserving` (placeholder; depends on receipt doctrine).
- `SafetyBridge.lean` — `SafetyEnv` bundle (same shape as `Corrective.RecoveryEnv`) under which `AuthorizedStep ∧ SafetyEnv.witness → SafetyPreserving`.
- `ExamplesTwo.lean` entry; `WHAT-THE-LEAN-STACK-PROVES.md` non-claim update.

Reuse: `Corrective.RecoveryEnv` is the model — a bundled-obligation structure that makes a discipline non-optional at the type level. `SafetyEnv` is its sibling, not a parallel invention.

### Slice B — Process calculus completion (close the LocalBoundary aperture)

`LocalBoundary.lean` already lists its open obligations (lines 264–294). Body work, in order:

1. **`BadMerge.lean`** — counterexample. Construct `lb₁`, `lb₂`, `lbₘ` and exhibit a `ComponentReach` from `⟨P|Q, initialConfig⟩` that violates `NoInternalExternalExposure lbₘ.partition` when `MergeAdmissible.left_sound` fails. Until this lands, `MergeAdmissible` could be vacuously satisfiable and the aperture means nothing.
2. **Necessity theorem** — `merge_admissible_necessary`: necessity *for the named exposure-safety property under the current `LocalBoundary` model*. Not global necessity, not all process composition, not the laws of physics wearing Pi-calculus pajamas. Builds on the counterexample.
3. **Three+ bad-case corollaries** — boundary collision, authority widening, projection laundering (the easiest three to instantiate first; containment inversion and ambient authority leak come later). Each is a specific violation of `MergeAdmissible`. Currently paper-shaped in `papers/working/models/boundary-calculus/notes/locality-and-merge.md`; the work is to Lean-shape them.
4. **Restriction (ν)** — open when a precise hiding claim needs it. Hiding changes the action surface and would require a separate `LocalBoundaryHiding.lean` brick. A runtime consumer may supply an instantiation, but is not the authorization to formalize. Default: deferred.
5. **Determinism + confluence** for `ComponentStep` — open when a downstream formal theorem (refinement, trace equivalence) actually needs it. Default: deferred.

Once items 1–3 land, `LocalBoundary.lean` is eligible to be wired into `LeanProofs.lean` and out of the experimental ghetto. That is the move that would earn a compositional / process-calculus claim, which 1.0 explicitly does not make.

### Slice C — Non-self-modification (Frontier 3, wrapper-first)

Most theorem-shaped of the frontiers, deliberately deferred per dependency order. **First pass is a wrapper module, not a mutation of `StateTransition.lean`.** Mutating the 1.0 transition primitives this early leaks the 2.0 surface backward into the 1.0 era and risks reopening the named compatibility claim.

`LeanProofs/Admissibility/SelfModification.lean`:

- `StepAllowedWithActor` — wrapper over the existing `StepAllowed`, adding an actor-policy binding parameter (relation `Binds : Actor → Policy → Prop`).
- A wrapper-level *policy-amending step shape* — an action class classified by the wrapper, not assumed as an existing `Step` constructor in the 1.0 kernel.
- `IsSelfAmendment : Actor → Step → Prop` — true when the wrapper classifies a step as mutating a policy that binds the actor.
- `SelfAmendmentTrap.lean` (counterexample first) — actor uses authorized machinery to mutate its own binding rule.
- Bridge theorem: `no_self_amendment_authorized_step` under the wrapper.

Touch `StateTransition.lean` only after the wrapper establishes that the shape belongs in the core and the promotion review accepts the compatibility cost. A later consumer may strengthen that case, but the wrapper formalization may lead it. Default: the core does not change.

### Slice D — Belief coherence (Frontier 2)

After A and C are in, the kernel has enough vocabulary to take belief revision seriously without metastasizing into general epistemology. Per the Frontier doc's containment caution: *only the authorized-revision discipline, not belief revision in general.*

- `BeliefRevisionContradiction.lean` — counterexample. Authorized belief revision leaves dependents in contradiction.
- `BeliefCoherence.lean` — `BeliefState`, `Dependency`, `Contradicts`, `Revise` with the obligation *invalidate or revalidate dependents*.
- Bridge theorem: coherent revision under explicit dependency-bookkeeping hypothesis.

### Slice E — Annex disposition AND cross-axis composition (two separate things)

These are two different kinds of work and the plan keeps them separate:

**E.1 — Annex disposition (versioning/surface decision, not theorem work).** For each annex module, pick one of three fates:

| Disposition | Candidates |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **Promote** | `RecoveryMargin`, `ClosureEligibility`, `PublicReceiptRefinement` — recovery is currently scope-fenced out of 1.0; a body that claims recovery should name it. |
| **Keep annex / amputate** | `CrossBoundary*` family — either commit to the projection-discipline pattern as load-bearing or label as specimens. |
| **Defer** | everything else, until an intrinsic formal question or separate promotion case warrants it. |

**E.2 — Cross-axis composition (theorem work from a precise claim).** `FiatAdmissibility`, `NumericalAdmissibility`, and `WitnessInvariance` each explicitly defer composition lemmas. The work to bridge them is real, but:

- **Do not** create `Axes.lean` as an aesthetic aggregator. Premature symmetry is the square root of the thing.
- **Do** create the first cross-axis lemma when a specific, non-vacuous composition claim names the missing bridge. A consumer can test an instantiation or support promotion; it is not the permission slip for theorem work.
- Land `AxisCompositionFailure.lean` (counterexample) first if and when the work starts.

### Slice F — Drive/control (Frontier 4)

Claim-frontier first: identify a coherent primitive rather than formalizing a slogan. Prose and Lean may then iterate, and Lean may expose the right statement before any runtime code exists. No file work is proposed by this roadmap yet because the primitive is still half-shaped, not because a consumer is absent.

## Files in scope across the whole body (cumulative, not Phase 1)

New (Slices A–D), in the order each becomes eligible:

- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/AuthorizedNotSafe.lean` *(Phase 1 — only this)*
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/DefendedValue.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/SafetyPreserving.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/SafetyBridge.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/BadMerge.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/LocalBoundaryBadCases.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/SelfModification.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/SelfAmendmentTrap.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/BeliefRevisionContradiction.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/BeliefCoherence.lean`
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/AxisCompositionFailure.lean` *(when a precise composition question opens)*
- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/ExamplesTwo.lean` (grows with each landing)

Modified only after the corresponding slice and promotion review warrant it:

- `LeanProofs/Admissibility/LocalBoundary.lean` — remove EXPERIMENTAL status when Slice B items 1–3 land; wire into `LeanProofs.lean` root.
- `LeanProofs.lean` — wire new modules in as each lands.
- `FRONTIERS.md` — update each frontier's status; the doc already anticipates this.
- `WHAT-THE-LEAN-STACK-PROVES.md` — non-claim update after each slice.

Explicitly **not** modified by this plan:

- `CalculusOne.lean` — 1.0 surface is named and DOI'd. A 2.0 aggregator, if it ever exists, is a separate file (`CalculusTwo.lean`), not a mutation.
- `StateTransition.lean` — Slice C is wrapper-first.
- `Authority.lean`, `Derivation.lean`, `Execution.lean`, `Corrective.lean`, `Freshness.lean`, `SurfaceAuthorization.lean`, `WitnessInvariance.lean` — all 1.0 surface, untouched.

## Phase 1 — the only thing this plan asks for now

Ship `LeanProofs/Admissibility/AuthorizedNotSafe.lean`. One file. One counterexample. No bridge. No `SafetyEnv`. No new `DefendedValue` abstraction beyond what the counterexample requires inline. Build green. No `sorry`. Wire into `LeanProofs.lean`.

> Root-wired means build-covered; it does not mean public-surface-promised.

Then stop. The next move is decided after inspecting the shape of the wound that file makes visible — not before.

## Guardrails

- **Counterexample first.** Every slice ships its negative model before any bridge predicate. Otherwise the bridge predicate becomes attractive definition-shaped assertion, not earned structure.
- **Each row in the ledger pays rent.** A frontier with no row in [[frontier-proof-obligations]] is not closed.
- **Tractability is not load-bearing.** The temptation to start with Slice C (most theorem-shaped) is exactly the discipline-failure `FRONTIERS.md` warns against.
- **No sorry-based stubs.** Repo invariant since 2026-05-08; preserved here.
- **No 1.0 surface mutation.** The body is a successor, not a stealth rewrite.
- **The body is allowed to remain partially unbuilt.** This map names dependency order, not destiny.
- **Harder to fake, easier to reject.** Anything added to this plan should make the next theorem clearer to force, not the diagram prettier.
